# Comparing Geotagged #COVID19 Tweets to Geotagged #ToiletPaper Tweets [Lab 6]

### The COVID19 Pandemic
The Coronavirus disease outbreak has become a global pandemic and is upending everyday life in major nations like Italy, China, and now it is taking over the United States; The U.S. has just overtaken Italy and China for number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Much speculation exists around how a countries response to an infectious agent can inhibit spread, and extreme social distancing measures have been put in place across the United States. It is the reality that basic needs (healthcare, housing, food, basic care items) are not provided for many in the United States, and very few protections have been put in place in these unprecedented times. Shortages of items ranging from protective equipment like masks and gloves to basic necessities like water, food, and toilet paper, are occuring all over the U.S.; in particular toilet paper shortages are getting a lot of attention because panic buyers are taking more than their fare share causing some to go without. My task was to compare the share of geocoded #Covid19 tweets to #ToiletPaper tweets to see who is talking about what where.

We know that counties in states like California, New York, and Florida are facing an extreme number of Covid-19 cases from publicly reported data. What is interesting and shown by this comparison is the distinction between New York, a state which is tweeting much more about Covid-19 than toilet paper, and California, a state which is tweeting much more about toilet paper than Covid-19. Most states either have an equal share of Covid-19 to TP tweets, or a slightly higher Covid-19 share. What I've hypothesized based on this map is that either, New York is so overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases that it doesn't have the time to think about toilet paper (Maslows Heirarchy of Needs + have you been on twitter lately?? New York is a mess right now), or, that some of the people in California are selfishly overbuying toilet paper causing others to tweet about how they can't get any toilet paper. I propose that either of these situations could be mitigated by providing a properly funded and extensive Coronavirus stimulus bill for all individuals to provide necessary support, including healthcare, housing/rent support, hazard pay or unemployment stipend, food, and water.

This map was created using R and QGIS. Data was collected and files writen for #Covid19 and #ToiletPaper from Twitter using rtweet, and Census data was gathered using tidycensus, tidyverse, tigris, and sf. Share of population was calculated in QGIS and then compared for both tweets and mapped symbolically using Pretty Breaks.
