## Introduction to Spatial Autocorrelation

### What is Spatial Autocorrelation
Spatial autocorrelation is property of spatial data used to describe the measure of the spatial relationship between the locations or values at locations of a variable. Positive spatial autocorrelation refers to the tendency for the variable to cluster in location and value, while negative spatial autocorrelation tends to refer to dissimilar variation. There are several spatial statistics tools for analyzing spatial autocorrelation in geographic data.
### Moran's I
The Moran's I statistic measures spatial autocorrelation based on feature location and value, evaluating a set of features for clustering, dispersion, or randomness. This measure only indicates that similar values occur together, not whether clusters are composed of high or low values. The Moran's I statistic for spatial autocorrelation is as follows:
