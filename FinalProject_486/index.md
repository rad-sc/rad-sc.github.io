# Webmaps of Averaged Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus at Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Stations for the Past 10 Years
---

My previous analysis utilized the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to measure spatial autocorrellation of nutrient hotspots and coldspots at Chesapeake Bay water quality monitoring stations for the past ten years. I then used this data to qualitatively search for potential sources of pollution. Continuing with this project, I manipulated the data in R Studio to average the nutrient data for each point over the 10 years to make interactive webmaps where the data can be observed for each water quality station. These maps are meant to supplement the analyses performed on the previous project page. Webmaps can be accessed by clicking the title links below.
