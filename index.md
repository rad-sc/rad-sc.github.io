# 🌲 USDA Forest Service Research 🌳

#### [🗺️ Baltimore Stewardship Mapping Project 🗺️](project_STEWMAP/index.md)

##### As a research assistant for the USDA Forest Service I am updating Baltimore’s comprehensive map of the hundreds of civic groups partcipiating in environmental stewardship in Baltimore as part of the 2019 Baltimore STEWMAP Project. The project is currently ongoing, click the STEWMAP project link above to see some highlights. More information about Baltimore's stewardship mapping project and old stewardship maps and analyses can be found at the Forest Service's webpage, click the link below to be redirected to the site!

#### [🥒 Algal Biofuels Research 🥒](https://rad-sc.github.io/project_biofuels/Biofuels_Surf.pdf)
##### As a student researcher for the UMBC Biology Department I worked on an individual research project in Dr. Stephen Miller's algal biofuels lab. My project focused on using molecular biology techniques and recombiant DNA technology to genetically modify existing algal organisms and improve their capability to produce biofuels. While I am no longer a student at UMBC or in Dr. Miller's lab, I am continuing my work in algal science through my current position at the Intstitute of Marine and Environmental Technology. A summary of the progress I made on my undergrad research can be read on my project poster, which can be accessed by clicking the title link above. I hope to add additional pages on my projects at IMET, so stay tuned!
