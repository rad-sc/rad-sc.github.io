#### 🥒 Algal Biofuels Research 🥒
##### As a student researcher for the UMBC Biology Department I am working on an individual research project in Dr. Stephen Miller's algal biofuels lab. My project focuses on using molecular biology techniques and recombiant DNA technology to genetically modify existing algal organisms and improve their capability to produce biofuels. This project is still in progress, up to date information and methods can be read on my project poster, which can be accessed by clicking the title link above.
