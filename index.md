### [Baltimore Stewardship Mapping Project](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/stew-map/baltimore/)
As a research assistant for the USDA Forest Service I am updating Baltimoreâ€™s comprehensive map of the hundreds of civic groups partcipiating in environmental stewardship in Baltimore as part of the 2019 Baltimore STEWMAP Project. Below is an image of my most recent updates, however the map is still incomplete at this time. More information about Baltimore's stewardship mapping project and old stewardship maps and analyses can be found at the Forest Service's website, click the title above to be redirected to the site!

## Other Academic Works

### Algal Biofuels Research
As a student researcher for the UMBC Biology Department I am working on an individual research project in Dr. Stephen Miller's algal biofuels lab. My project focuses on using molecular biology techniques and recombiant DNA technology to genetically modify existing algal organisms and improve their capability to produce biofuels. This project is still in progress, up to date information and methods can be read on my project poster, which can be accessed by clicking the title link above.
