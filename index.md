### [Baltimore Stewardship Mapping Project](project_STEWMAP/index.md)
#### [STEWMAP Forest Service webpage](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/stew-map/baltimore/)
As a research assistant for the USDA Forest Service I am updating Baltimore’s comprehensive map of the hundreds of civic groups partcipiating in environmental stewardship in Baltimore as part of the 2019 Baltimore STEWMAP Project. Below is an image of my most recent updates, however the map is still in progress at this time. Some highlighted ideas for future analyses can be found in the STEWMAP project link above. 
More information about Baltimore's stewardship mapping project and old stewardship maps and analyses can be found at the Forest Service's webpage, click the second link above to be redirected to the site!

### Algal Biofuels Research
As a student researcher for the UMBC Biology Department I am working on an individual research project in Dr. Stephen Miller's algal biofuels lab. My project focuses on using molecular biology techniques and recombiant DNA technology to genetically modify existing algal organisms and improve their capability to produce biofuels. This project is still in progress, up to date information and methods can be read on my project poster, which can be accessed by clicking the title link above.
